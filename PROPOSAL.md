# Capstone Proposal
## Name of Student:
Hans J Schroeder

## Name of Project:
SchedulEase

## Project's Purpose or Goal:
During the recent Covid-19 pandemic, the nature of work changed for millions of employees across the world. Instead of having an office that people would show up to every day, many employees were forced to shift to a remote model. Now that much of the world is out of lock-down, many people are returning to their offices, while others choose to continue working from home. Others have adopted a hybrid model, splitting their time between remote work and in-office work. SchedulEase will be designed as a tool for these types of employees to share their intended work schedule with their coworkers, eliminating confusion about who will be where and when, and to what degree they are available that day.  

## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose
- Employees will have the ability to post their main statuses for the day such as whether they are in-office or remote, when they will be on lunch breaks, or when they will be in a meeting. Furthermore, they can indicate if their "door is open" versus "do not disturb"
- Employees will be able to see the statuses of their coworkers
- Authorization will be implemented

## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or resources will you use to create this MVP?
- React for the JavaScript framework
- Firebase/Firestore for back-end such as Authentication
- CSS/Bootstrap for styling
- HTML

## If you finish developing the MVP, what will you work on next? 
- Database containing previous days' schedule statuses
- Employees can post out their schedule for the full week
- Messaging between users

## What Additional tools, frameworks, libraries and other resources will these features require?
- NoSQL
- Redux

## Is there anything you'd like your instructor to know? 
After spending a decent amount of time researching how to do this within the timeframe we have, I feel that building out the MVP with clean, concise code will take the majority of my time. As such, styling is considered low priority at the moment. I am more concerned with having a stylistically unappealing product that works well than I am with a beautiful application that isn't very useable 
*Update 9/10/22: After having spent much time researching best practices as well as learning more about the purpose and primary function of programming in React, I have come to the decision that styling is just as important as the functional aspect. As such, the above statement is no longer entirely true*
