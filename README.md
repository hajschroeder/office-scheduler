## Description

This is a Capstone project built independently by the author for the coding bootcamp Epicodus. The intent is to be an application where workers can post their schedule for the day for their coworkers to see, and they can also see their coworkers' schedules. They will have the ability to post things such as whether they are remote or in-office, in a meeting, in "do not disturb mode", in "open door" mode, or on break.
